I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Utah. My current research is on efficient streaming algorithms for topological analysis. I graduated from BYU with a BS in computer science. While there I worked as a Software Developer for a research group, where I mainly worked on the analysis of EEG readings, and data management. I also worked as a research assistant in the HCMI Lab, where I programmed robot swarms to perform various tasks. During that time I also worked as a TA, helping to re-work the Programming Languages course, and picking up five new languages on the way. I am currently looking to transition to a full time position.

This site consists of a few of the projects I have worked.
