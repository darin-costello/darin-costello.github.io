I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Utah. My current research is on efficient streaming algorithms for topological analysis. I graduated from BYU with a BS in computer science. While there I worked as a Software Developer for a research group, where I mainly worked on the analysis of EEG readings, and data management. I also worked as a research assistant in the HCMI Lab, where I programmed robot swarms to perform various tasks. During that time I also worked as a TA, helping to re-work the Programming Languages course, and picking up five new languages on the way. I am currently looking to transition to a full time position. My resume can be found at <https://www.darin-costello.github.io/data/resume.pdf>

I spend much of my free time in the kitchen, either baking artisan bread or trying new recipes from around the world. You can see some of my baking exploits on Instagram [@betteroffbread](https://www.instagram.com/better.off.bread/) where I explore and experiment with the art of bread making. I'm  also interested in sustainable and alternative food production. I have a small community garden plot in which I'm growing beans, tomatoes, tomatillos and various flowers, as well as a window fogponics system helped I design and build. I'm hoping to expand it in the future to include automated humidity, water, and nutrient regulation.
