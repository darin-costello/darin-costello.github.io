This project probably my very first 'big' software project I did outside of class. I wrote it while in my Sophomore year. I wrote this a couple years later, and so it's meant to show it off, but also as a bit of a retrospective talking about things I would change if I were to do it over again.

Problem
==========
The psychology lab I worked for focused on a form of behavioral analysis called operant conditioning. While most of the research focused on human behavior, they also ran a series of small pigeon experiments. However, the data created was difficult to use and required a lot of copy and paste into excel. Having no RA's board enough to do it,  no analysis happened and the data just built up resulting in a 10 year backlog. My job was to fix this by providing software that would show the experiments, perform some initial aggregations, and output a CVS of useable format.

Feel free to skip to the [results](#Results).


Process
========

The software needed three things, a database, a way to load the data into the database (ETL), and a simple gui to access the data. 

#### Database ####

The data itself was pretty simple, each pigeon underwent several experiments, each experiment had associating data describing which experiment was being conducted, and then there was the time coded data of the experiment itself.  So, all I needed was to link the data to the experiments by a key, and for convenience create a table for each pigeon. The final tables looked like this.

{% highlight SQL %}

CREATE TABLE pigeon (
	subject INTEGER NOT NULL,
	totalExperiment NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

CREATE TABLE experiment (
	start INTEGER NOT NULL,
	end INTEGER NOT NULL,
	subject INTEGER NOT NULL,
	[group] INTEGER NOT NULL,
	box INTEGER NOT NULL,
	MSN TEXT NOt NULL,
	experiment INTEGER NOT NULL,
	e_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT);

CREATE TABLE data(
	experimentID INTEGER NOT NULL,
	letter TEXT NOT NULL,
	second INTEGER NOT NULL,
	value REAL NOT NULL);

{% endhighlight %}

It turned out having the pigeon table wasn't all that useful, as the same data is pretty easily accessible from the experiment table, and it kinda just complicated the import logic. Also a lot of experiments had been run poorly, thus it was unknown which pigeon was doing the experiment. All unknown pigeons where given the number zero, which ended up being about half of them.

#### ETL ####

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The format of the file changed slightly depending on the experiment type.
That is different letters would still have a single or multiple data points, but there meanings and which letters used would change.
The format was pretty easy to parse, but it had to be easily customizable for each experiment type. I ended up creating four parsers, plus a header parser.
The parsers where: ignore single point, ignore multiple data points, parsers single data point, parsers multiple data Point, and parsers multiple data points with sum first. These would just hook onto the stream in order, and store there results into a map. 
Thus to import a new experiment one would only need to specify order of parsers.
To import meaning to the letters, each experiment type also had a hard coded map of letters to strings. Finally experiment type was determined by matching against the MSN field in the header, using some simple regular expressions.  


##### Retrospective #####
The major change would be to add an experimentType table which would describes different experiments, and link a letters there english meaning and corresponding parsers.  This would remove the hard coded nonsense I used, and make it easier to add new experiment types. The parsers  are a bit inelegant, and should probably be reworked. 


#### GUI ####

The GUI was straight forward. I used Java Swing, thus the dated look, and used simple DOA objects to access the data from a SQLite database. Being a SQL novice I ended up doing most of the aggregation and formatting in Java which lead to the JVM running out of memory. This was fixed by manually calling the GC, but would have been avoided If the process was just done in SQL instead of created so many model objects. I also should have allowed selection of multiples instead of drop down menus.

It worked as expected, and after showing it off the lab said it was exactly what they wanted, however they never really got around to analysis the data, though they did start a few new pigeon experiments in the mean time.
